# Xiaomi Robot Vacuum Binding

This Binding is used to control a Xiaomi Robot Vacuum.

## Supported Things

This Binding supports Xiaomi Mi IO devices (Several Xiaomi wifi devices).
Currently mainly the Xiaomi Robot Vacuum is supported

## Discovery

The binding needs a token from the Xiaomi Robot Vacuum in order to be able to control it.

Below firmware version firmware version 3.3.9_003073:
In order to fetch the token, reset the robot vacuum, connect to its the network its announcing (rockrobo-XXXX) and run the discovery again. After the token is retrieved you can connect the vacuum to your phone again.
Once connected to your phone & the regular wifi network, run discovery once more to retrieve the new ipaddress.

Firmware version 3.3.9_003073 & higher
Newer firmware change the token upon inclusion in the mihome app. The token needs to be retrieved from the application database (find the mio2db file with and read it sqlite). The easiest way on Android to do is by using [MiToolkit](https://github.com/ultrara1n/MiToolkit/releases)

For iPhone, use an un-encrypted iTunes-Backup and unpack it and use a sqlite tool to view the files in it: 
Then search in "RAW, com.xiaomi.home," for "USERID_mihome.sqlite" and look for the 32-digit-token.

## Binding Configuration
No binding configuration is required.

## Thing Configuration

The binding needs ip address and token to be able to communicate. See discovery for details.
Optional configuration is the refresh interval and the deviceID. Note that the deviceID is automatically retrieved when it is left blank.

## Channels

note: the  `actions#commands` channel can be used to send commands that are not automated via the binding.
e.g. `smarthome:send actionCommand  "upd_timer['1498595904821', 'on']"` would enable a pre-configured timer. See https://github.com/marcelrv/XiaomiRobotVacuumProtocol for all known available commands.
